# Eat the Burger!

This is a simple web application that allows people to add different kinds of burgers to the screen - then devour them. Burgers that can be devoured are located in the left side of the screen, while already devoured burgers are on the right. Pressing the 'Devour' button next a burger will devour it and move it to the right side. The data can be reset using the Reset button.

The purpose of this project was to leverage handlebars view templates with an Express and MySQL backend.

This project is deployed on [Heroku](https://bks-burger.herokuapp.com/)
